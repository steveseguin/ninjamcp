==============================================

This document grants an additional permission under Section 7 of the GNU Affero
General Public License version 3 (AGPL-3.0-only) for the VDO.Ninja MCP package.

1. Covered MCP Files
--------------------
This exception applies only to files distributed as part of an official
`@vdoninja/mcp` package release (the "Covered MCP Files"), including files
listed in the package's published `files` allowlist.

2. Official Distributions
-------------------------
An "Official Distribution" of Covered MCP Files means a copy distributed by
Steve Seguin as part of:

- the npm package `@vdoninja/mcp@X.Y.Z` (a specific published version), and/or
- a tagged release `vX.Y.Z` of:
  - https://github.com/steveseguin/ninjasdk (directory `MCP/`), or
  - https://github.com/steveseguin/ninjamcp

and any byte-for-byte identical mirror of that exact Official Distribution.

3. Unmodified
-------------
"Unmodified" means byte-for-byte identical to an Official Distribution of the
same Covered MCP File, including preservation of any license notices.

4. Additional Permission
------------------------
Notwithstanding the other terms of the AGPL-3.0-only, you are granted permission
to use, copy, combine, bundle, link, and convey the Covered MCP Files in
Unmodified form as part of a larger work (a "Larger Work"), and to convey that
Larger Work under terms of your choice (including proprietary terms), without
requiring that the Larger Work as a whole be licensed under the AGPL.

5. Conditions
-------------
This additional permission applies only if:

- the Covered MCP Files are Unmodified; and
- you comply with the AGPL-3.0-only requirements applicable to conveying verbatim
  copies of the Covered MCP Files (including preserving notices and providing
  recipients a copy of the AGPL license).

6. Modified Versions
--------------------
If you modify any Covered MCP File, this additional permission does not apply to
that modified file or to any Larger Work that includes that modified file.

7. No Other Permissions
-----------------------
This exception grants no rights beyond those stated above.
